# Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of creating an ARM template to deploy your app and setting up a GitHub Actions pipeline workflow file for automated deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Azure subscription
- GitHub repository for your app

## Step 1: Create an ARM Template

1. Open the Azure Portal and navigate to the resource group where you want to deploy your app.
2. Click on the **Deploy a custom template** option.
3. Select **Build your own template in the editor**.
4. In the editor, define the resources you want to deploy. You can use the [Azure Resource Manager template syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/template-syntax) to define your resources.
5. Save the template file with a `.json` extension.

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions

1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the **Actions** tab.
2. Click on **Set up a workflow yourself** to create a new workflow file.
3. Define the workflow file using the [GitHub Actions syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions).
4. Add a step to deploy your app using the ARM template created in Step 1. You can use the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest) or the [Azure PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/new-azureps-module-az?view=azps-12.0.0) to deploy the template.
5. Save the workflow file with a `.yml` extension.

## Step 3: Configure GitHub Secrets

1. In your GitHub repository, navigate to the **Settings** tab.
2. Click on **Secrets** and then **New repository secret**.
3. Add any required secrets, such as Azure credentials or connection strings, that are needed for the deployment.
4. Save the secrets.

## Step 4: Test the Deployment

1. Make a change to your app code and push it to the repository.
2. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository to see the workflow running.
3. Monitor the workflow logs to ensure the deployment is successful.
4. Verify that your app is deployed and running in Azure.

Congratulations! You have successfully created an ARM template to deploy your app and set up a GitHub Actions pipeline workflow file for automated deployments.

For more information, refer to the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/) and [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
